This repository contains the geotiff2atak tool. When provided with a collection of GeoTIFF (.tif/.tiff) raster maps, it converts them into single-file geospatial data packages, such as GPKG, that are compatible with ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit).
**In a nutshellâ€”this is a offline tool used to generate offline maps compatible with TAK environments.**

<i>Note that his tool could potentially be further developed to create orthomosaic maps, which are generated from images captured during drone missions. Orthomosaic is like Google Earth, but way sharper. It is a large, map-quality image with high detail and resolution made by combining many smaller images called orthophotos. While there are excellent free tools for orthomosaic creation ([WebODM](https://www.opendronemap.org/webodm/)), my objective is to create a tool that can be easily deployed on a "Raspberry Pi" or other low-cost single-board computers that can be used "out in the field". However, those features are only a concept at the time being.</i>
