This repository contains the geotiff2atak tool. When provided with a collection of GeoTIFF (.tif/.tiff) raster maps, it converts them into single-file geospatial data packages, such as GPKG, that are compatible with ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit).

**In a nutshellâ€”this tool is used to generate offline maps compatible with TAK environments.**
